## Project: Rock Paper Scissors

Basic rock paper scissors game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Features:
UI with buttons to select choices, and a "Go" button to submit choice, that way the choice between "rock", "paper", or "scissor" can be changed.

Winning, losing, or tie-ing will result in a funny little gif and sound effect.

View the console to see more information about what you chose and what the CPU chose.
